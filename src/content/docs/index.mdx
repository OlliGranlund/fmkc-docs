## About the Community

Despite the first organized meetup in Finland only consisting of 3 persons, weâ€™ve managed to gain attraction meetup after meetup. After each meetup, the community grew more and more. Today, we have over 1300 people in our Discord, with several active Finnish vendors and a lovely community spirit.

Started in 2017.
