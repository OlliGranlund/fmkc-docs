- **Location**: Kaisaniemi, Helsinki  
- **Date**: 19.7.2021  
- **Attendees**: ~10  

As the community had matured and people clearly had other interests beyond just keyboards, we decided to have a non-keyboard keyboard meetup outdoors as the summer was at its best. We had a cozy time, played some yard games, and enjoyed beverages. Despite the name of the event, some people brought keyboards with them.
