- **Location**: Siili Solutions Helsinki
- **Date**: 19.1.2019
- **Organizers**: 2
- **Attendees**: 40ish?
- **Keyboards**: 50ish?

The word started to spread out and suddenly we had around 40 signed up for a meetup.com event. As we grew, we also started to look for sponsors. This meetup was the first sponsored meetup. Siili Solutions offered the space and beverages while WASD-Keyboards, KBDFans, and Komplett offered some giveaways. People stayed for a long time and everyone has a good time.
