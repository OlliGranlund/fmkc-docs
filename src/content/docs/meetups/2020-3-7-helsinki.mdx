- **Location**: Oodi library, Helsinki
- **Date**: 7.3.2020
- **Attendees**: 25ish
- **Keyboards**: Yes
- **PERKELE?!?**: Yes

As the community became more and more active, some decided that it was time to create a community keyboard. We organized an event where the attendees would receive their PRKL30 keyboard. Due to some technical issues, we werenâ€™t able to laser cut PRKL30-cases but had a good time whatsoever.

This was our last before Covid-19. Despite not having meetups, for the time being, the community has been really active with different projects like custom cases, custom PCBs, artisan keycaps etc.
