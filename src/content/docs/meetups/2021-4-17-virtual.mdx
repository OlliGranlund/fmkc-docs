- **Location**: Twitch.tv
- **Date**: 17.4.2021
- **Hosts**: 3 (ElPedro, Hekeke and olligranlund)

Due to the global pandemic, we decided to host a virtual meetup as we were not able to find a location that allowed meetups of our size. We had a great time discussing various projects that had been going on in the community, and also rewarded some members who had been active and kept the spirit up despite the rough times.

One of our active moderators, Hekeke, already did quite often livestreams of gameplays, so we decided to host the meetup on his channel.
