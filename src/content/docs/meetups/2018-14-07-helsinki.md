- **Organizers**: 2  
- **Attendees**: 1  
- **Keyboards**: 10  

Despite only being 3 people in the first meetup, it was really nice to try out different keyboards. We didn’t think this would take off due to the lack of interest. Apparently, we just hadn’t enough publicity which was seen in later events.
