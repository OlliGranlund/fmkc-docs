- **Location**: Sofokus Helsinki
- **Date**: 14.7.2018
- **Organizers**: 2
- **Attendees**: 12?
- **Keyboards**: 20ish?

Somehow there was a sudden spike in the number of attendees. Being 12 people in a medium-sized office room wasnâ€™t optimal and we already had to start thinking about a bigger location to host the next meetup in. This was also when we created our Discord channel and things started to grow.
