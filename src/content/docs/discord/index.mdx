## Guide to Our Discord Channels

Our Discord server is a vibrant community where discussions happen in both Finnish and English. Here’s a quick guide to the main channels and what they’re for:

- **#info-psa**: Stay updated with announcements and information about various FMKC events.  
- **#yleinen-näppistely**: Engage in casual discussions about keyboards and related topics.  
- **#noob-friendly**: A safe space to ask beginner questions and get helpful, non-opinionated answers without any judgment.  
- **#diy-rakennushommia**: Share and discuss DIY projects, from keyboard builds to custom mods.  
- **#showroom**: Showcase your keyboards, keycaps, and other gear.  
- **#showroom-discussion**: Dive deeper into discussions about the keyboards and setups shared in the showroom.  

We also have a variety of off-topic channels for non-keyboard-related discussions. If something doesn’t fit anywhere else, feel free to use **#offtopic**.
